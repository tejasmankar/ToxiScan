# Privacy Policy for ToxiScan
_Last Updated: May 19, 2025_

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how ToxiScan ("App") uses your device's camera and handles any related data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Controller Information
ToxiScan is provided by Devtejman. We act as the data controller for the processing of image data through Google's Gemini API, though we do not store any user data on our servers.

## Camera Usage
ToxiScan requests access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of allowing you to take photos that are processed using Google's Gemini API. This functionality is a core feature of our application that enables analysis of the image content to detect toxins.

## Data Collection and Processing

**What we do:**
- Allow you to capture photos using your device's camera
- Temporarily process these photos on your device
- Send these photos to Google's Gemini API for analysis
- Display the analysis results back to you within the app
- Use Google Sign-In for authentication purposes, without storing any authentication data on our servers
- Receive basic subscription status information from Google Play to verify your access level
- Display ads through Google AdMob for users on the free tier
- Limit free tier users to 5 image scans per day (tracked locally on the device only)

**What we do not:**
- Store any user data on our servers (including photos, analysis results, or authentication data)
- Collect, process, or store any payment information
- Permanently save any photos you take using our application
