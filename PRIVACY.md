# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 19, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how our application uses your device's camera and handles any related data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Camera Usage

Our application requests access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of allowing you to take photos that are processed using Google's Gemini API. This functionality is a core feature of our application that enables analysis of the image content to detect allergens and toxins.

## Data Collection and Processing

**What we do:**
- Allow you to capture photos using your device's camera
- Temporarily process these photos on your device
- Send these photos to Google's Gemini API for analysis
- Display the analysis results back to you within the app

**We do not:**
- Permanently store or save any photos you take using our application
- Use your photos for any purpose other than the analysis described above
- Share your photos with any third parties beyond Google's Gemini API
- Retain the image data after analysis is complete

## Third-Party Services

Our application uses Google's Gemini API to analyze photos. When you take a photo in our app, it is sent to Google's servers for processing. Google may store and process this data according to their own privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy at [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information about how they handle data.

## Permission Usage

When you first attempt to use a feature requiring the camera, you will be prompted to grant camera permission. This permission is only used when you actively choose to take a photo within our application. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data during transmission to Google's services. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security during transmission.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
